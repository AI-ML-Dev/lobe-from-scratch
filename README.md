# A Kids Guide to Lobe.AI - From Scratch!

[Lobe.AI](https://www.lobe.ai/) is Microsoft's tool to _help you train machine learning models_ in a free, easy-to-use way. We often hear the words "so easy a child could do it!". And we believe Lobe.AI is just that easy. So we created an illustrated guide to Lobe.AI, along with kid-friendly project ideas and tutorials, as a **pAIr-ent programming** introduction to Lobe.AI.

In the context of the [AI Kids Kit](https://aka.ms/ai-kids-kit), this project will demonstrate assets and templates to support _conversational_ learning, _pair_ programming, and _parent-child_ project ideas that can help kids see and explore AI concepts in a real world context at home and school.

## Project Goals

 * Create an illustrated guide to Lobe.AI for kids and parents to use
 * Create conversational content that helps parents navigate discussions and brainstorm ideas
 * Show sample Lobe.AI projects with default sofware (train it, use Lobe starter web or mobile to test it)
 * Export Lobe.AI models and explore use with other environments (MIT Scratch, App Inventor, Microsoft MakeCode etc.)

This project was conceived during the Microsoft Fix-Hack-Learn event - while all goals may not be met in time for deadline, we hope to show sufficient proof of concept and resources to indicate viability, and continue to follow-up with this beyond the event.

## Project Assets

The plan is to provide some subset of these in time for the Fix-Hack-Learn deadline, but continue to add others over time to provide a meaningful template and learning resource for _pAIr-enting_ projects.

| File | Purpose  | 
|:---|:---|
| Transcript | Sample conversational transcript for discussion between parent and child |
| Visuals  | Illustrated tiles for conversation that can be repurposed in many different media |
| Fonts | Specifically, fonts created _by_ (or in collaboration with) kids in the K-8 range. |
| Stories | Some example assets that showcase the above in different contexts |
| Projects | Working projects - with tutorials (steps) and models (outcomes) for others to try |

---

## Project Collaborators

I was specifically interested in getting a _child's eye view_ of this project and am enlisting some help from kids to validate the transcript and help craft relevant stories and projects in a way other kids can relate to. The guide will feature two projects up front - both of them done by a 13yo (middle schooler) to showcase real-world ease of using Lobe.AI

 * `Don't Ask Me!` is a project for classifying coffee pods so I wouldn't have to ask him what coffee I was drinking.
 * `Is Candy Good For Me?` is a project for classifying Halloween Candy by name (if single) or as "multiple" (if many in image)

Project specific code and documentation will be kept in a separate folder and linked here for reference.

## Project Structure

The purpose is to explore the use of Lobe.AI models in Scratch projects, and create a template/tutorial that allows others to replicate this for new Lobe.AI-friendly use cases. The project structure is as follows:

| File | Purpose  | 
|:---|:---|
| README | This file. Describe what the project does, where things are located, how to run it. |
| docs/ | Folder containing documentation of steps, 1 file per step (with images) |
| docs/static | Folder for hosting static assets (e.g., images used in steps) |
| docs/stories | Completed artifacts that show examples of using project assets or models |
| models | Put assets from the completed Lobe.AI model here |
| training | Put images used to train the model here (if needed)|
