# Use Lobe.AI From Scratch

The purpose is to explore the use of Lobe.AI models in Scratch projects, and create a template/tutorial that allows others to replicate this for new Lobe.AI-friendly use cases. The project structure is as follows:

| File | Purpose  | 
|:---|:---|
| README | This file. Describe what the project does, where things are located, how to run it. |
| docs/ | Folder containing documentation of steps, 1 file per step (with images) |
| docs/static | Folder for hosting static assets (e.g., images used in steps) |
| models | Put assets from the completed Lobe.AI model here |
| training | Put images used to train the model here (if needed)|
